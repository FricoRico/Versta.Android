## Language Models
Our application uses OpusMT models for translation (more language frameworks to be added in the future). These models are open-source and can be found on the [OpusMT GitHub page](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/Opus-MT). The models that we use in the app are optimized for mobile devices and use [ONNX runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) for inference. This means that they are lightweight and efficient, providing fast and accurate translations without requiring an internet connection. 

In order for the models to be compatible, our conversion tools can be used to export the models to the required format. More information on our [Versta.Models](https://github.com/FricoRico/Versta.Models) Github page.

## Feedback
Your feedback is crucial to the development of Versta. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/FricoRico/Versta.Models/issues) page.

Thank you for choosing Versta! Together, we can break down language barriers and enhance communication for everyone.
